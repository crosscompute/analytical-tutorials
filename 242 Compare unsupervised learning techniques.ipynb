      "\n",
      "The goal in manifold learning is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while still preserving its structure, so that similar samples are close together.\n",

      "## Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "- Visualize sample space\n",
      "- Determine whether two new samples are similar\n",
      "\n",
      "## Types\n",
      "\n",
      "- Linear projections\n",
      "- Locally linear embedding and its regularized variations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Practical considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "- Scale samples\n",
      "- Remove noisy data\n",
      "- Remove identical samples\n",
